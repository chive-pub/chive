ORCID linking is optional but recommended for identity verification.

3. Click "Save"

Changes sync to your PDS and appear immediately on Chive.

## Profile Visibility

Profiles are public by default. The following information is always visible:

- Eprints authored
- Reviews and endorsements

The following can be hidden in settings:

- Email address
- Location
- Activity statistics

## Claiming Eprints

If eprints were imported from external sources (e.g., arXiv) before you joined Chive, you can claim them:

1. Go to Dashboard > Claims
2. Find your eprint
3. Provide evidence of authorship
4. Submit claim

Claims are reviewed manually and typically processed within 48 hours.

## Profile Analytics

Your dashboard shows:

- Views on your eprints
- Citation counts
- Download statistics
- Engagement metrics

Analytics are private to you unless you choose to display them on your profile.

## Deleting Your Profile

You can delete your Chive profile at any time:

1. Go to Settings > Account
2. Click "Delete Account"
3. Confirm deletion

Deletion removes your profile from Chive but does not affect data in your PDS. Your eprints remain accessible via their AT URIs.
