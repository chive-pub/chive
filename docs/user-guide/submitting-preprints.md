# Submitting Preprints

This guide covers the preprint submission process in detail.

## Before You Submit

Ensure you have:

- A PDF of your preprint (maximum 100 MB)
- Required metadata: title, abstract, keywords
- An AT Protocol account (e.g., Bluesky)
- Co-author consent for multi-author submissions

## Submission Workflow

### Step 1: Authentication

Click "Sign In" and authenticate with your PDS. Chive uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication; your credentials are never stored on Chive servers.

### Step 2: Start Submission

Click "Submit Preprint" to open the submission form. The form has four sections.

### Step 3: Basic Information

| Field    | Required | Description                                  |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Title    | Yes      | Full title of your preprint                  |
| Abstract | Yes      | Plain text summary (recommended: 300 words)  |
| Keywords | Yes      | At least one author-provided keyword         |
| License  | Yes      | Creative Commons license (CC-BY recommended) |

### Step 4: Authors

Add all authors with their affiliations:

1. Click "Add Author"
2. Enter name and affiliation
3. Optionally link to ORCID
4. Drag to reorder authors
5. Mark corresponding author

### Step 5: Upload Files

**PDF Upload**

Drag and drop your PDF or click to select. The file uploads directly to your PDS. Chive stores only a reference (BlobRef) to the file.

**Supplementary Materials** (optional)

Add datasets, code, or additional figures. Each file has a 50 MB limit. Supported formats: PDF, ZIP, TAR.GZ.

### Step 6: Classification

Select fields from the knowledge graph:

1. Type to search for fields
2. Click to select (maximum five fields)
3. Selected fields appear as tags
4. Click X to remove a field

### Step 7: Review and Submit

Review all information on the summary page. Click "Submit" to create the preprint record in your PDS.

## After Submission

Your preprint is indexed within minutes. You receive a permanent URL to share with colleagues.

### Editing Metadata

You can update metadata at any time from your dashboard. Changes are reflected immediately.

### Uploading New Versions

Click "New Version" on your preprint page to upload a revision. Include a changelog describing the changes.

### Withdrawing

Click "Withdraw" to remove your preprint from Chive. The record remains in your PDS but is no longer indexed.

## Multi-Author Submissions

For preprints with multiple authors:

1. One author (the submitter) creates the submission
2. Co-authors are notified via email if addresses are provided
3. Co-authors can claim their authorship through the claiming flow

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails**

Check file size (maximum 100 MB) and format (PDF only for main manuscript).

**Cannot find field**

If your field is not in the knowledge graph, propose it via the governance system.

**Indexing delayed**

New submissions typically appear within five minutes. If your preprint is not visible after one hour, contact support.
