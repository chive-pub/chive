# Endorsements

Endorsements are public signals of support for an eprint from community members. They indicate which aspects of the research an endorser found valuable.

## What is an Endorsement?

An endorsement indicates that a researcher vouches for specific contributions of an eprint. Unlike anonymous peer review, endorsements are public and linked to the endorser's identity.

When you endorse an eprint, you select one or more **contribution types** that you're endorsing. This tells others exactly what you found valuable about the work.

## Contribution Types

Endorsements use a fine-grained system based on the CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) framework. Contribution types are managed as nodes in the knowledge graph with `kind: 'type'` and `subkind: 'endorsement-kind'`.

### Core Research

| Analytical     | Statistical, computational, or mathematical analysis        |
| Theoretical    | Theoretical framework, conceptual model, theory development |
| Empirical      | Data collection, experiments, observations, fieldwork       |

## Giving an Endorsement

1. Open the eprint you want to endorse
2. Click "Endorse" in the sidebar
3. Select one or more contribution types you're endorsing
4. Optionally add a comment explaining your endorsement
5. Submit

Endorsements are recorded in your PDS and displayed on the eprint page.

## Viewing Endorsements

Endorsements appear on:

- The eprint detail page (sidebar with counts by contribution type)
- Search results (endorsement count badge)
- Author profiles (endorsements given)

The endorsement summary shows how many endorsers selected each contribution type, giving readers a quick overview of the paper's strengths.

## Endorser Visibility

Anyone with an AT Protocol account can endorse eprints. Endorsements from established researchers may carry more weight in search rankings based on:

- Account age
- Number of authored eprints
- Verification status (e.g., ORCID linked)
- Previous endorsement history

## Updating or Withdrawing Endorsements

You can update your endorsement at any time:

1. Open the eprint
2. Click "Your Endorsement"
3. Modify your contribution type selections or comment
4. Save changes

To withdraw an endorsement:

1. Open the eprint
2. Click "Your Endorsement"
3. Click "Delete Endorsement"

Deleted endorsements are removed from display and from your PDS.

## Endorsement Ethics

### Do

- Endorse work you have actually read
- Declare any relationships with authors in your comment
- Select contribution types that accurately reflect the paper's strengths

### Do Not

- Endorse in exchange for reciprocal endorsements
- Endorse work outside your expertise without disclosure
- Use endorsements for self-promotion
