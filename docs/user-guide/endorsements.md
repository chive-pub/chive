# Endorsements

Endorsements are public signals of support for a eprint from recognized community members.

## What is an Endorsement?

An endorsement indicates that a qualified researcher vouches for the quality and significance of a eprint. Unlike anonymous peer review, endorsements are public and linked to the endorser's identity.

## Endorsement Types

### Personal Endorsement

An individual researcher endorses a eprint based on their expertise. The endorser's profile and credentials are visible.

### Organizational Endorsement

An organization (e.g., research group, journal) endorses a eprint. Organizational endorsements require authorized representatives.

## Endorsement Levels

| Level       | Meaning                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Read        | Endorser has read the eprint                 |
| Verified    | Endorser has verified key claims or methods    |
| Recommended | Endorser recommends the eprint to colleagues |

## Giving an Endorsement

1. Open the eprint you want to endorse
2. Click "Endorse" in the sidebar
3. Select your endorsement level
4. Optionally add a brief statement
5. Submit

Endorsements are recorded in your PDS and displayed on the eprint page.

## Viewing Endorsements

Endorsements appear on:

- The eprint detail page (sidebar)
- Search results (endorsement count)
- Author profiles (endorsements given)

## Endorser Eligibility

Anyone with an AT Protocol account can endorse eprints. However, endorsements from established researchers carry more weight in search rankings.

Factors that increase endorsement visibility:

- Account age
- Number of authored eprints
- Verification status (e.g., ORCID linked)
- Previous endorsement history

## Withdrawing Endorsements

You can withdraw an endorsement at any time:

1. Open the eprint
2. Click "Your Endorsement"
3. Click "Withdraw"

Withdrawn endorsements are removed from display but remain in the historical record.

## Endorsement Ethics

### Do

- Endorse work you have actually read

- Use endorsements for self-promotion
