# Quick Start

Submit your first eprint to Chive in under five minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Bluesky account (or any AT Protocol-compatible PDS)
- A eprint PDF (maximum 100 MB)
- Metadata: title, abstract, and at least one keyword

## Step 1: Sign In

Navigate to [chive.pub](https://chive.pub) and click "Sign In" in the header. You will be redirected to authenticate via OAuth with your PDS.

## Step 2: Create a New Eprint

After signing in, click "Submit Eprint" in the navigation bar. You will see a multi-step form.

### Basic Information

Enter the required metadata:

| Field    | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title    | Full title of your eprint                              |
| Abstract | Summary of your work (plain text, 300 words recommended) |
| Keywords | Author-provided keywords for discovery                   |

### Upload PDF

Drag and drop your PDF or click to select a file. The PDF is uploaded directly to your PDS; Chive only stores a reference (BlobRef) to the file.

### Classification

Select fields from the knowledge graph hierarchy. Start typing to search for relevant fields. You may select up to five fields.

## Step 3: Submit

Review your submission and click "Submit Eprint". The eprint record is created in your PDS and automatically indexed by Chive.
