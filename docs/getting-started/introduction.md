# Introduction

Chive is a decentralized eprint service built on the AT Protocol. It provides researchers with a platform to share scholarly work while maintaining data sovereignty.

## What is Chive?

Chive functions as an AppView in the AT Protocol ecosystem. It indexes eprints from user-controlled Personal Data Servers (PDSes) and presents them through a unified interface. Users retain full ownership of their content; if Chive were to disappear, all eprints would remain safely stored in their respective PDSes.

## Key Features

### Decentralized Publishing

Eprints are stored in user PDSes, not on Chive servers. This ensures researchers always control their work and can migrate to other platforms at will.

### Community Review

Open peer review with inline comments and endorsements. Reviews are public and linked to reviewer identities via AT Protocol DIDs.

### Knowledge Graph

A Wikipedia-style moderation system allows the community to propose and vote on field classifications. Authority records ensure consistent metadata across the platform.

### Faceted Search

Ten-dimensional PMEST classification (Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time) plus FAST facets enable precise discovery of related work.

### Plugin Ecosystem

Integrate with external services: ORCID for author identification, DOI for persistent identifiers, Zenodo for archiving, and more.

## Who is Chive for?

Chive serves researchers across disciplines who want to share eprints while retaining ownership of their work. It is particularly suited for:

- Researchers who value data sovereignty and portability
- Communities that want transparent peer review processes
- Projects that require integration with multiple scholarly services
- Organizations that need compliance with open access mandates
